React.js and Java Spring application that provides stock prices based on the user's stock symbol input. 

Users can enter a stock symbol (Ex: MSFT, AAPL, TSLA) and the application will return the current price of that stock. 

The application uses React.js for the front end and Java Spring for the back end. 

A REST API sent and retrieved data from the front and back end to create the full stack environment. 

The back end utilizes finnhub.io's API to gather current stock data and will fetch the stock price based on the symbol inputted from the front end. 

The back end is currently on a private repository.
