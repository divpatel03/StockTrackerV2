React.js and Java Spring application that provides stock prices based on the user's stock symbol input. 

Users can enter a stock symbol (Ex: MSFT, AAPL, TSLA) and the application will return the current price of that stock. 

The application uses React.js for the front-end and Java Spring for the back-end. 

To create the full stack environment, a REST API was used to send and retrieve data from the front and back-end. 

The back-end utilizes finnhub.io's API to gather current stock data and will fetch the stock price based on the symbol inputted from the front-end.
